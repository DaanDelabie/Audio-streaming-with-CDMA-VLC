# Audio-streaming-with-CDMA-VLC

The Python code that can be found is responsible for a thread-based audio streaming platform, applied to a VLC setup.
This code was written for a master's thesis in 2020.

The setup uses TI DAQs, and a linear LED driver. In addition, multiple access is supported using CDMA.
The transmitter and receiver can be completely separated from each other with this code as synchronization is provided for this packet based streaming platform.
